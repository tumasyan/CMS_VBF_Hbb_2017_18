# Instruction for VBF_Hbb 2017 DoubleBTag
  Stage 2 (no need of CMSSW area, just Root including TMVA package)

  Training with TMVA: Jet combination and Signal_vs_Background discrimination 
  Samples (Root files with NTuples: 7-PT leading jets and "Other" variables) should be located at
  SingleBTag/Preselected_NTuples/
  Where
  Training__Training5perc__.root      is 5% of Data for MVA training
  Training__Training__.root           is full preselected Data ~ 7.73 fb-1
  Training__VBFHToBB_M_125__.root     is VBF_Hbb MC preselected sample
  ... (NTuples of other MC samples)

# For Analysis

cd DoubleBTag/Analysis
1. PuReWeighting results are in CMS_VBF_Hbb_2017_18/Common/Pu_ReWeight/
   All MC-Samples are reweight according to 
   https://github.com/UHH2/UHH2/wiki/Pileup-reweighting-for-MC
   with SimGeneral.MixingModule.mix_2017_25ns_WinterMC_PUScenarioV1_PoissonOOTPU_cfi
   In addition VBF_Hbb Sample is secondary reweighted as it was done with "wrong" PU (not PU2017)

2. b-jets identification in signal process with high-discriminator criteria
     cd BJets_Identification
   Checking Final selection performance with b-tag discriminator
     root -l High_btag_Selected_Jets.C

3. Making Ntuples for Signal vs Background Discrimination and Final Results
     cd ../Making_Ntuples_For_SigBkgDiscrimination
   3.1 For data derived approach
     cd Data_Derived/
     root -l Data_Derived.C
   3.2 For MC derived approach. This step also should be done in order to provide MC/Data comparison.
     cd MC_Derived/
     root -l MC_Derived.C

4. Signal vs Background discrimination using TMVA and final results
     cd ../../TMVA_Signal_vs_Background_Separation/
   For data derived approach (Recommended)
     cd withData
   MVA (Gradient BDT) Training
     root -l TMVAClassification.C
   Creating Mbb for Signal_MC (VBF and ggF), Bakground (5% of Data) and Observed (Full Data) based on Trained BDT
   Ooutput will be Mbb_All.root, which will be used in fits (estimation of deviation from pure-background model)
     root -l Mbb_For_Sig_Bkg_Obs.C
   Comparision of BDT responce for Signal_MC (VBF_Hbb_MC) and observed (Data_2017F)
     root -l bdt_res.C
     root -l Compare.C
   BDT variables were optimized with N-1 test.To set "Under-ROC integrall" vs "variable" dependece switch off "variable" in TMVAClassification.C and
     cd Nm1_Test/
     root -l ROC_Integrall.C
   Results ("variable importance") of optimized variables 
     root -l Nm1Res.C
   For MC derived approach (NOT recommended, NO sufficient MC-statistics, fluctuations are significant)
     cd ../../withMC
   MVA (Gradient BDT) Training
     root -l TMVAClassification.C

5. MC vs Data comparison.
   Goto CMS_VBF_Hbb_2017_18/SingleBTag/Analysis/TMVA_Signal_vs_Background_Separation/withMC/
   Get data based trained .xml
     cp -r ../withData/dataset .
   Mbb correlation: Mean_Mbb vs BDT-output. This is first step of background model validation
     cd Correlation/
     root -l mbb_Correlation.C  (takes a while - 3-5 min)
   Make Data vs MC comparison for various variables:
   PT1, PT2, PT3 -> First 3 pt-ordered jets in event.
   BTG1, BTG2 -> b-discriminator of 1st and 2nd b-jets.
   MINVQQ, DETAQQ, PTALL, MINVBB ... Use the script AllScr.sh
     cd Data_vs_MC/
     cp -r ../dataset .
     ./AllScr.sh
